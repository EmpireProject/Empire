9/23/2016
---------
-Version 2.0.0 beta, DerbyCon release

-Listeners abstracted out to modules
    -Flask used for listener/http instead of base http server
    -client key negotiation abstracted out and implemented in agents

-New nested "routing/metadata" packet structure introduced in prep for additional transports
    -all packetes now wrapped with an HMAC'ed RC4 "routing" packet that uses the staging key
        -this is so all agents can decrypt 'routing' information for future p2p comms 
    -increases flexibilty for malleable comms (i.e. sessionid removed from POST requests)
    -removes the need to keep track of which URIs are used for tasking/post/staging

-Agent data handling improved and abstracted away for listener module use
    -handle_agent_data() handles raw packets, usable by any listener module
        -handle_agent_staging() handles agent key exchange/staging
        -handle_agent_request() handles an agent tasking request
        -handle_agent_response() handles an agent result response

-EmPyre integration:
    -Start of integration of EmPyre staging/comms implemented in listeners/http
    -Agent is language-aware:
        "interact AGENT" drops you into the language-appropriate agent menu
        "usemodule [tab]" from an agent only tab-completes language-appropriate modules
    -stagers were broken out into operating system designations:
        -stagers.generate_launcher() now accepts a language specification, which wraps
            the stager generation functionality for listener module

-PowerShell:
    -RC4 implemented for first stage obfuscation
    -staging now uses HMAC and nonces
    -epoch-syncing removed
    -core agent cleanup

-Listeners:
    added http
    added http_foreign (for 'foreign' Emire listeners)
    added meterpreter (for meterpreter/cobalt strike, using Invoke-Shellcode)
    added management/switch_listener module which switches an agent to a new listener module comms
    redid hop listeners, added listeners/http_hop
    added listeners/http_com which uses IE com objects for communications

-Tons of bug fixes (and new bug introductions :)
-Removed lots of code rot
-Vastly increased debugging output (--debug 2)
-New 'Language'/'MinLanguageVersion' options added to modules
-stagers now have a 'language' option, and are folder-separated by operating system
-added @mattifestation's AMSI bypass into PowerShell stagers 'safe checks'
-redid PowerShell jobs architecture to use a separate app domain instead of PowerShell jobs
-Added key reneogitation in case agents are 'orphaned'
-moved stager.ps1/stager.py to ./agent/stagers/http.ps1 / ./agent/stagers/http.py
-agent generation now patches in the comms methods into the base agent.ps1 (need to do agent.py)
-powershell listeners are now properly hot-swappable with management/switch_listener
-the external/generate_agent module will now generate a staged agent and preregister it (only for PowerShell at this time)
-PowerView code updated
-PowerUp code updated
-new tables -> results and taskings to separate out stuff for the RESTful API 
-CLI/RESTful API broken, needs testing
